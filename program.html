    <div class="section-content"><strong>Title:</strong> Multimodel Inference in Software Reliability</div>
    <div class="section-content">
        Accurate prediction of the cumulative number of software faults as well as quantitative software reliability has been still a challenging issue in software reliability for a long time. Especially, weighted combinational models based on multiple software reliability growth models (SRGMs) have received a considerable attention to improve the prediction accuracy, but have not been satisfactorily formulated during the last five decades. In this paper, we develop novel approaches to predict the future behavior of the cumulative number of software faults detected in the system testing, by means of multimodel inference consisting of both the model averaging and clustering techniques, where the underlying SRGMs are described by the common non-homogeneous Poisson processes. The model averaging techniques employed here possess an information-theoretic and frequentist perspective, and are characterized by well-known information criteria to determine the each model weight. Several clustering techniques are also applied to cluster the underlying SRGM candidates for prediction. In comprehensive numerical experiments with both time-domain and time-interval software fault count data, we compare our SRGM averaging techniques with the common approach based on the single use of SRGM. It is shown with actual software fault count data that SRGM averaging enabled us to improve the prediction accuracy significantly.

    <div class="section-content"><strong>Title:</strong> Recent Research Progresses on Optimal System Reliability Design</div>
    <div class="section-content">
        Optimal system reliability design is an important research field in reliability engineering. Since the 1950s, extensive studies have been conducted on various aspects of this issue. This field remains highly active today due to the need to develop new generations of complex engineering systems, such as 5G telecom networks and high-performance computing clusters, which are expected to be highly reliable to meet the stringent, dynamic, and often real-time quality demands of system operators and end-users.
    </div>
    <div class="section-content">
        Over the past five years, numerous new researches on optimal system reliability design have been published, addressing the theoretical challenges posed by the new engineering systems. This presentation will systematically review these works with the focus on theoretical advancements, including the models and methods for redundancy allocation problem, redundancy allocation under mixed uncertainty, joint reliability-redundancy allocation problem and joint redundancy allocation and maintenance optimization. Through analysis and discussions, we will outline future research directions.

    <div class="section-content"><strong>Title:</strong> Mean Residual Life-based Replacement in Multi-Unit Systems</div>
    <div class="section-content">
        In this talk, we deal with a preventive replacement problem for multi-unit systems. First, we assume that the units in systems are identical, and the failures of units are independent and follow an exponential distribution. Secondly, it is assumed that the replacement time is negligible, the fixed and variable costs to replace failed units are included, and the expected cost rate is used as an optimization criterion. 
    </div>
    <div class="section-content">
        We propose a preventive replacement policy based on the mean residual life of the system. If the system is failed before the mean residual life of the system is greater than the specified threshold (the decision variable), then the system is replaced correctively. Otherwise, the system is replaced preventively when the mean residual life of the system is less than the threshold. A procedure to obtain the expected cost rate is developed and an algorithm to find the optimal threshold of the mean residual life is also proposed under some well-known system structures in reliability.
    </div>
    <div class="section-content">
        Numerical examples are studied to know the effects of model parameters on the optimal solutions in various system structures. The optimality of the policy proposed is investigated by some machine learning techniques approximately in cases of discrete failure distributions. For further studies, we analyze preventive replacement policies for extended failure and cost models and promising optimization problems.
